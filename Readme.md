Weather App
This is a simple Python application that fetches current weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It displays the weather condition and temperature in Fahrenheit for the specified city.

How it Works
The app prompts the user to enter the name of a city. It then makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for that city. If the city is found, it prints out the current weather condition and temperature. If the city is not found, it displays a message indicating that no city was found.

Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure you have the following:
Python installed on your system
An API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free API key here https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
